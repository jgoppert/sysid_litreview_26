# System Identification Benchmark

Benchmark website: https://jgoppert.github.io/sysid_litreview_26/

This project compares the latest machine-learning-based and classical
system-identification methods on fixed-wing aircraft problems. The goal is to
make method comparisons reproducible across shared simulated and real-flight
datasets, with common data formats, common metrics, generated paper artifacts,
and a static benchmark browser published through GitHub Pages.

## Repository Layout

- `benchmark/`: orchestration, registries, schema, website export, and plugin API.
- `models/`: canonical 3DOF/6DOF aircraft dynamics and synthetic dataset helpers.
- `methods/`: method implementations and plugin examples.
- `datasets/`: contributed dataset manifests, validation, and preprocessing code.
- `data/`: compact committed real datasets only, as flat NPZ split files.
- `work/`: ignored raw downloads, intermediate processing, and generated simulator data.
- `results/`: benchmark CSVs and metadata.
- `latex/fig/` and `latex/tables/`: generated paper figures and tables.
- `site/`: static GitHub Pages application.

## Quick Local Test

Run the setup smoke check:

```bash
./results.py check-setup
```

This compiles the benchmark modules, validates contributed dataset manifests and
compact NPZ files, discovers method plugins, regenerates website JSON, and runs a
small deterministic 6DOF model smoke simulation.

Serve the benchmark website locally:

```bash
./results.py serve-site
```

Open the printed `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` URL.

## Data Format

Committed real datasets use flat split files:

```text
data/<dataset_id>_train.npz
data/<dataset_id>_validation.npz
```

Each NPZ stores the canonical ragged time-series arrays plus scalar
`dataset_id` and `split_name` fields. Validate committed datasets with:

```bash
./results.py check-data
```

The current real dataset is `sportcub_mocap_4_17_26`; its raw Sport Cub data is
not committed. The dataset manifest and canonicalization code live under
`datasets/sportcub_mocap_4_17_26/`.

See [docs/DATASET_CONTRACT.md](docs/DATASET_CONTRACT.md) for the required NPZ
schema and [docs/BENCHMARK.md](docs/BENCHMARK.md) for the full workflow.

## 6DOF Benchmarks

Generate the standard 6DOF synthetic dataset family into ignored `work/data/`
directories:

```bash
./results.py simulate-6dof --dataset-modes open_loop sine_sweep aggressive trim_grid
```

Run the full local 6DOF baseline workflow:

```bash
./results.py all-6dof
```

This generates synthetic train/validation data, runs the implemented 6DOF
baselines with explicit method-specific training splits, exports website JSON,
and refreshes LaTeX-ready figures/tables. Synthetic simulator outputs are not
committed because the 6DOF aero model is expected to change.

The current 6DOF dynamics are a nonlinear small-aircraft benchmark with
body-axis aerodynamic forces and moments, smooth stall onset, post-stall drag
rise, control-effectiveness loss, actuator lag, direct-state measurements, and
mocap-style position/quaternion measurements.

## Sport Cub Real Data

The provisional Sport Cub motion-capture dataset is registered as
`sportcub_mocap_4_17_26`.

```bash
./results.py process-dataset sportcub_mocap_4_17_26
./results.py canonicalize-dataset sportcub_mocap_4_17_26
./results.py check-data sportcub_mocap_4_17_26
./results.py sportcub-real
```

`canonicalize-dataset` writes the flat committed NPZ files under `data/`.
`sportcub-real` summarizes the current 6DOF grey-box OEM result into
`results/sportcub_mocap_4_17_26_method_comparison.csv` and refreshes the
website data bundle.

## Method Contributions

Method contributions are split from benchmark-result generation:

1. A method PR adds plugin code and docs under `methods/plugins/<method_name>/`.
2. CI validates imports, plugin metadata, website data, and compact datasets.
3. A maintainer runs full benchmarks on trusted hardware and commits regenerated
   results separately.

See [docs/CONTRIBUTING_METHODS.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING_METHODS.md).

## Website And Release

The static site reads JSON from `site/public/data/`. `./results.py web-data`
refreshes that bundle locally. GitHub Actions runs CI on PRs, `main`, and
release tags matching `v*`; the Pages workflow deploys only after a successful
CI workflow run.

## Local GPU Benchmark

For a full local run on an NVIDIA workstation:

```bash
./results.py suite \
  --device cuda \
  --jobs 30 \
  --threads-per-worker 1 \
  --max-gpu-workers 2 \
  --input-channel u_cmd
./results.py latex-assets
./results.py web-data
python3 latex/paper.py build
```

See [docs/SELF_HOSTED_GPU.md](docs/SELF_HOSTED_GPU.md) for the self-hosted
runner setup.
